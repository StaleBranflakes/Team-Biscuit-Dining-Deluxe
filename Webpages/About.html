            <h2>About Dining Deluxe</h2>
            <p>
                Dining Deluxe is your personalized guide to campus dining at UNC Pembroke. We created this platform to make eating on campus easier, more inclusive, and more intuitive for everyone—students, faculty, staff, and visitors alike.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our goal is to provide clear, accessible, and customizable food information so you can make informed choices that fit your lifestyle and preferences.
            </p>

            <p><strong>With Dining Deluxe, you can:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🍽️ <strong>Explore daily menus</strong> across all campus dining locations</li>
                <li>🌿 <strong>Filter food options</strong> by allergens, dietary preferences, and restrictions—like vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal, and more</li>
                <li>🤖 <strong>Get personalized meal suggestions</strong> using our AI-powered assistant, which recommends dishes based on your input (diet, allergies, cravings, etc.)</li>
                <li>🔍 <strong>Search for specific ingredients or meals</strong> so you always know what fits your lifestyle</li>
                <li>🚫 <strong>See when items are out of stock</strong>—staff can update ingredient availability in real time, and students may also help flag shortages to keep the system accurate and up to date</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Dining Deluxe also features tailored account access:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Students</strong> can view menus, filter options, and receive personalized suggestions</li>
                <li><strong>Staff and dining team members</strong> have enhanced access to update inventory, mark items as running low or out of stock, and help keep the system responsive to real-time changes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We believe campus dining should be clear, customizable, and collaborative. With Dining Deluxe, we’re making it easier for everyone at UNCP to eat well, stay informed, and feel supported—one meal at a time.
